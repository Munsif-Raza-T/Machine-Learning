06/06/2022, 19:41 - Tabish Memon (19SW Sec 1): Hello People,
Recently I had a meeting with the faculty of our department, and I was told that this year in Open Day, 19 batch has to submit their FYP idea. It used be in the 7th semester when all the students had to submit/present their ideas in front of the judges and then the judges would decide if the idea is worth being FYP or if it is feasible enough and realistic to be made. If the idea is suitable, it is then selected to be the FYP of the certain group, otherwise the group had to work on any project suggested/given by the faculty. From now on, all this will be done in the 6th semester. We all have to research, work, and present our idea in the coming SPEOD (Open Day) which is most probably going to happen in the last week of August or 1st week if September. I will provide a template presentation which will help you to get your work done and to know what things you need to have for your project. 
Other details will be shared soon.

And also, it was told that 19 batch has to work on FYP individually, but I came to know that we will be working in pairs. (I will let you know if something changes.)
Any queries, do ask me, or ask your CRs.
06/06/2022, 19:43 - Tabish Memon (19SW Sec 1): And this submission is mandatory for 19 batch! It is a part of our whole FYP thing.

15/08/2022, 01:02 - Rashid Wassan: @923118239764, please elaborate the whole FYP selection process once. Tbvh, most of us have no any clue how things will happen.
15/08/2022, 01:02 - Chaudhary Faisal Khalil SW: exactly
15/08/2022, 01:15 - Tabish Memon (19SW Sec 1): The scene is, deadline 22 August he obviously, lekin FYP ki bt abhi Share nhi hui, 2 maheeny pehly se hi mene ye bt batayi hui thi ky august me Open Day hoga jisme 19 batch ne apny FYP ka abstract submit karwana he, the other thing ky SES cooperate kry, tw initially jo dates di gayin thi mujhy wo August ka 1st week tha, mene isko august ky end week me karwaya he qky vacations thi usme impossible hojata he project pe kaam krna
15/08/2022, 01:16 - Tabish Memon (19SW Sec 1): And the list @923078611011  mentioned jisme se Fyp select krna hota he, wo tb hota he jb apka idea reject hojaye, agr me koi idea pitch karun or wo idea reject hojaye tw then mujhy ek list di jaati he jisme se me idea select karunga
15/08/2022, 01:19 - Tabish Memon (19SW Sec 1): Koi bhi idea select krna he apni marzi he, uska abstract banana he workflow technologies konsi use hongi, q ye project q ye technology, pura project banaky nhi dena just abstract, agr prototype he tw behtar he agr nhi tw just abstract. Usky bd wo ap  ne video banaaky present krna he and jo normally open day me hota he, usky bd apko bataya jayega ky apka jo fyp idea he wo thk he ya apko list me se select krna parega.
15/08/2022, 01:20 - Tabish Memon (19SW Sec 1): And dates ki bt he tw I wanted to make it 1st week of September, lekon 18 walon ka FYP process lamba he isliye zyada se zyada august ki end tk kiyaa
15/08/2022, 01:30 - Tabish Memon (19SW Sec 1): And han, about the team members ky 2 q hen 3 q nhi, tw initially 18 me bhi 2 hi thy team me, lekin unky paas projects list me kam hogaye thy and students zyada hogaye thy isliye phr 1 group me 3 ko adjust krdiya tha
15/08/2022, 01:31 - Tabish Memon (19SW Sec 1): And, I am doing everything in my hand to get the dates extended. But, SES ko bhi department ky hisaab se hi chalna parta he, ye events ki dates saara kuch Chairman bataty hen TechArena, OpenDay and all, ye unki hi dates ky hisaab se hoti hen

26/08/2022, 22:06 - +92 308 3266254: Due to torrential rain, many areas of Sindh have flooded and caused massive destruction. The people in my hometown, Khuhra, are suffering. There has been no electricity for more than ten days, the signals are extremely weak ( we have little to no contact with our relatives), and people do not have water to drink, let alone food. Houses have collapsed. The ones still intact have electric currents flowing all over the place. As of now, the victims affected are residing in a strongly built school nearby, but all cannot be accommodated. All connecting roads are blocked. Even the dead no longer rest at peace as all the graveyards have been demolished. 

My family and I have taken on this responsibility personally. We are trying to do all that we can for them. But there's only much we can do alone. We need your help! Donations of any kind are appreciated.
